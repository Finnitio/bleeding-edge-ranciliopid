# ranciliopid - Open source PID for your espresso maschine

BLEEDING EDGE MASTER VERSION 

Version 2.1.0 beta4

based on the Rancilio-Silvia PID for Arduino described at http://rancilio-pid.de

# Most important features compared to rancilio-pid master:
1. New PID Controller "Multi-state PID with steadyPower (Bias)"
   - Distinct PID settings dependend on the current "state" of the maschine. 
   - Most of the settings are either static or semi-automatically tuned, which does not require an PHD (German: Diplom) to understand.
   - Currently 5 states are implemented:
     - Coldstart (maschine is cold)
     - Coldstart stabilisation (directly after coldstart)
     - Inner Zone (temperature near setPoint)
     - Outer Zone (temperature outside of "inner zone")
     - Brewing
   - steadyPower is introduced which compensates the constant temperature loss due to environment
   - steadyPowerOffset is introduced which compensates the increased temperature loss when the maschine (brew head etc.) are still very cold.
   - PidController offers feature like filtering, special handling of setPoint crossings and more (hard-coded)
   - PID Controller is now integral part of the software and not an external library.
1. Beautify display output with new icons (thanks to helge!)
1. Freely choose if you want the software use WIFI, BLYNK and MQTT. Everythink can be enabled/disabled and stil have a flawlessly working PID controller.
1. Offline Modus is fixed and enhanced. If userConfig.h's FORCE_OFFLINE is enabled, then PID fully is working without networking. Ideal in situations when there is no connectivity or you dont want to rely on it.
1. Huge performance tunings and improvements under the hood which stabilizes the system (eg in situations of bad WIFI, hardware issues,..).
1. MQTT support to integrate maschine in smart-home solutions and to easier extract details for graphing/alerting.
1. Added RemoteDebug over telnet so that we dont need USB to debug/tune pid anymore (https://github.com/JoaoLopesF/RemoteDebug). While using OTA updates you can remotely debug and update the software!
1. "Brew Ready" Detection implemented, which detects when the temperature has stabilized at setPoint. It can send an
   MQTT event or have hardware pin 15 triggered (which can be used to turn a LED on).
1. All heater power relevant settings are now set and given in percent (and not absolute output) and therefore better to understand
1. Safetly toogle added to shutdown heater on sensor malfunction (TEMPSENSORRECOVERY)
1. Many useful functions to be used internally getAverageTemperature(), pastTemperatureChange() + updateTemperatureHistory())

# ATTENTION:
- This software is tested thoroughly with the pid-only hardware solution on Silvia 5e, and with a permanently run full-hardware solution on an 10 year old Silvia. I am grateful for any further feedback. 
- Please monitor our maschine's temperature closely the first few run times. The muti-state pid controller should never lead to temperatures greater than 5 degress above setpoint!

# Instructions on how to migrate from official rancilio to bleeding-edge
Installation is as explained on http://rancilio-pid.de/ but with following adapations:
1. Make screenshots of the official "Blynk App Dashboard" so that you can revert anytime.
1. Copy file userConfig.h.SAMPLE to userConfig.h and edit this file accordingly.
1. (Optional) Enable blynk in userConfig and build the "Blynk App Dashboard" as described below.
   OR just disable blynk in userConfig, enable debug logs and use one of the methods described in "Debugging Howto" to monitor the first few runs.
1. Flash and enjoy your espresso.
1. No tuning should be required normally. If you want/need to then use the method described below.

# Additional information
- If you see the following error during compile "Height incorrect, please fix Adafruit_SSD1306.h!", then search for the file Adafruit_SSD1306.h in your Documents/ folder and adapt Line 72ff to match following code:
  ```
  #define SSD1306_128_64
  //#define SSD1306_128_32
  //#define SSD1306_96_16
  ```
  Also check and fix all files matching "Adafruit_SSD1306.h" in your Documents/ subfolder!!

# Blynk App Dashboard
Unfortunately you have to manually build your dashboard (config does not fit in QR code).
Please stick to the following screenshots and use the "virtual pin mapping" as described:

## Alternative way to clone blynk app dashboard (experimental)
- Login to your server on which blynk is installed
- install the programm jq (should be included in any distribution)
- Shutdown blynk Service
- Search for file in blynk/data which looks like <email>.Blynk.user. This is the config file. Make a backup of this file.
- Download this project's config [rancilio_v2.json](https://github.com/medlor/ranciliopid/blob/master/blynk/rancilio_v2.json) and put it in the same folder as the config file.
- Execute following command in this folder:
  ```
  jq --argjson blynkInfo "$(<rancilio_v2.json)" '.profile.dashBoards += [$blynkInfo]' YOUR_EMAIL.Blynk.user
  ```
- Startup blynk service
- Open App, Search newly create project, Open the "Project Settings" then devices-> Master -> Master and Press "Refresh Token". Use this token in the rancilio software as auth token.

# Tunings instructions
1. Enable debug mode and have a look at the logs
1. Adjust coldstart (state 1 and state 2):
   - The goal is to adapt "StartTemp" that after power-on of the cold (<50 Celcius) maschine and upon reaching "state 3" the temperature is around 0.5 Celcius below setPoint. 
   - Loglines to look for:
     - State 3 is reached: "\*\* End of Brew. Transition to step 3 (normal mode)".
       If this is >1 Celcius below setPoint, then increase "StartTemp" by this amount.
       If this is >0.5 Celcius above setPoint, then decrease "StartTemp" by this amount.
     - "StartTemp" too high: "Disabled steadyPowerOffset because its too large or starttemp too high"
       Probably you have to decrease setPoint by at least 1 Celcius.
1. After this is configured correctly, you can determine your steadyPower value. 
   - The maschine including the case and brew head to be hot by having it run for at least 1h (for Siliva 5E just power-on the maschine again when it turned off)
   - Check the "SteadyPower" value in the logs or the blynk app. This value is normally around 4-6% and is your optimum value. Set this value in your userConfig.h and check regularly if this is still set. 
   - During regular operations the auto-tuning will adapt this value by up to 1 Celcius up/down. This is normal.
1. After this is configured correctly, you can configure your steadyPowerOffset and steadyPowerOffsetTime.
   - When the maschine's metal is cold additional heat is lost. By configuring an additional power to the heater (steadyPowerOffset in percent) for steadyPowerOffsetTime seconds (counting from power-on) you can compensate this.
   - When the maschine is cold and the heater-power to reach the setPoint quickly enough is not sufficient, you can increase steadyPowerOffset.
   - When the maschine is cold, coldstart is correctly configured and after reaching "state 3" the temperature is falling rapidly and > 1.5 Celcius below setPoint, you probably should increase steadyPowerOffset also.
1. After this is configured correctly, you should configure the PID values for inner-zone and outer-zone.
   - These settings should be tuned very carefully because small changes might have huge impacts.
   - k := tune in 5 steps. Mostly useful when the temperature is not coming closer to the setPoint, even over a longer period.

# Debugging Howto
1. Enable debugging
   - Open your userConfig.h file and uncomment following line:
   ```
   #define DEBUGMODE
   ```
1. Getting debug logs 
   - on windows
     - Download [putty](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe) for windows or use telnet in linux to connect to port 23 of the rancilio-maschine's IP-address: 
       <p align="center">
       <img src="https://github.com/medlor/ranciliopid/blob/master/pictures/putty/putty.jpg" height="300">
       </p>
   - on linux
     ```
     sh> $ telnet rancilio-ip-address 23
     ```
   - on andriod, following apps are recommended
     - [Fing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing)
     - [JuiceSSH](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh)
     - Just open Fing, search for your "rancilio device" as defined in userConfig.h's HOSTNAME, then press on the device -> "Offene Ports finden" -> "Porr 23" -> "Verbinden mit Telnet-Client"
     - To export the protocol just long press on one of the log-lines and choose "save/share".
   - with Web-Browser
     - Open the file ```rancilio-pid\src\RemoteDebugApp\index.html``` with firefox/chrome and enter your rancilio-ip in the upper left field.
1. Explanation of the PID log line
   ```
   [0m(D p:^5000ms) 435 Input= 93.46 | error= 0.54 delta= 2.45 | Output= 27.88 = b:52.10 + p: 0.86 + i: 0.00( 0.00) + d:-25.09
   ```
   - 435 := Time since power-on of the arduino (in seconds)
   - Input= 93.46 := Current temperature
   - error= 0.54  := Temperature difference calculated by (target_temp - current_temp)
   - delta= 2.45  := Change in temperature in the last 10 seconds
   - Output= 27.88 := Heater Power (in percent)  
     which is calcucated by the sum of:
     - b: 5.10        := steadyPower (in percent)
     - p: 0.86        := PID Kp (in percent)
     - i: 0.00( 0.00) := PID KiSum (KiLast) (in percent)
     - d:-25.09       := PID Kd (in percent)

# How to use a simple LED as brewReady signal
- The easiest way is to use arduino GPIO15. For this to work you have to connect a resistor and in parallel another resistor with the led in series. This has to be connected between GPIO Pin 15 and GROUND.  
- A technical description can be found here https://www.forward.com.au/pfod/ESP8266/GPIOpins/index.html
- Required configuration in config.h:
  - #define BREW_READY_LED 1
  - #define BREW_READY_DETECTION 0.2  # or any other value

# Instructions on how to update to the latest version of bleeding-edge
1. Just overwrite all existing files with a newly released version.
2. Open your userConfig.h file, which had not been overwritten in previous step, and manually check (line by line!) that all updates to the new file userConfig.h.SAMPLE are reflected in your own userConfig.h. 
3. Compile, upload and enjoy!

- 1.9.8f:
  - Added missing config.h.SAMPLE variables.
  - Added some more mqtt events.
- 1.9.8e:
  - Removed movAvg() due to several issues:
    - This is no moving avg, but something different (but it is working for "stable" temperature curves).
    - readIndex=0 is not used.
    - movingAvg does not compares currentValue with previousValue.
    - Faktor *100 makes no sense (?).
    - initializing methods/firstreading is refactored.
  - movAvg() is replaced by pastTemperatureChange() (+ updateTemperatureHistory())
  - Change order of brew-detection in main loop() to not confuse bPid.compute() due to flapping setTunings()

  - Feature: Detect missing temperature polls.
  - Feature: Add configurable BLYNKPORT.
  - Feature: Wifi hostname configuable.
  - New feature: Safe-guard: Stop heating forever if sensor is flapping!
  - Fix: Pid.Compute() is now in sync with isrCounter and is not loosing one tick each second. Heater flapping is reduced.
