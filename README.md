# Changelog
- 1.9.8e:
  - Removed movAvg() due to several issues:
    - This is no moving avg, but something different (but it is working for "stable" temperature curves).
    - readIndex=0 is not used.
    - movingAvg does not compares currentValue with previousValue.
    - Faktor *100 makes no sense (?).
    - initializing methods/firstreading is refactored.
  - movAvg() is replaced by pastTemperatureChange() (+ updateTemperatureHistory())
  - Change order of brew-detection in main loop() to not confuse bPid.compute() due to flapping setTunings()
  - Feature: isBrewReady() to determine if temperature is stable to start brewing
  - Bugfix: Replace abs() with fabs().
- 1.9.8d:
- 1.9.8c:
  - Add more mqtt updates: kp,ki,kd, coldstart
  - Safe-guard: be sure pid internals are cleared when pid is dis/enabled.
- 1.9.8b:
  - Feature: Add support for MQTT.
  - Safeguard: HeaterPreventFlapping must never be > windowSize.
- 1.9.7:
  - Fix: If temperature sensor detects more than 150Celcius then it must be an error.
  - Fix: Typos / explanations.
  - Fix: Race condition when code is blocked for some time
  - Fix: Added initial temp poll to prevent error on start.
  - Feature: Detect missing temperature polls.
  - Feature: Add configurable BLYNKPORT.
  - Feature: Wifi hostname configuable.
  - New feature: Safe-guard: Stop heating forever if sensor is flapping!
  - Fix: Pid.Compute() is now in sync with isrCounter and is not loosing one tick each second. Heater flapping is reduced.
